# Codex Orchestrator State

Updated: 2026-05-01
Owner: Codex orchestration window

Purpose: durable coordination notes for parallel implementation. This file tracks
agent windows, pending story-done work, unlocks, and known blockers. It is not the
authoritative story status tracker; `production/sprint-status.yaml` remains the
source of truth for story status.

## Current Policy

- Do not block new implementation work on GitHub Actions unless CI reports a red
  failure that needs repair.
- New workers use one Git worktree and one branch per story:
  `D:\_DEV\claude-code-game-studios-worktrees\<story-id>` on
  `work/<story-id>-<short-slug>`.
- Workers run local Developer PowerShell checks, commit explicit owned paths,
  push their story branch, and report branch name, commit hash plus CI run if
  available.
- The root checkout stays reserved for orchestrator integration merges,
  story-done, CI triage, and state tracking.
- Story-done windows are serialized because they edit shared production files.
- Keep commits scoped. If the pre-commit hook blocks due to mixed files, unstage
  and re-add explicit owned paths.
- Existing shared-tree workers already launched before the worktree switch may
  finish normally; do not migrate them mid-story.

## Live Windows Confirmed By User

- CA-005 worker: initial readiness run returned NEEDS WORK on stale manifest
  version and missing performance budget. Story fixed at `94267fb`; worker
  completed on branch `work/ca-005-purchase-flow` at `415384a`;
  cherry-picked into `main` at `c6141bc`; story-done committed at `a770db2`.
  Window can be cleared.
- OBJECTIVE-001 worker: initial readiness run returned NEEDS WORK on stale
  manifest and too-few acceptance criteria. Story fixed at `10d738f`; worker
  completed locally on branch `work/objective-001-state-model` at `0ca676d`;
  push was blocked by credentials, so root cherry-picked it into `main` at
  `38a5489`; story-done committed at `0b847cb`. Window can be cleared.
- COMBAT-001 worker: completed locally on branch
  `work/combat-001-resolve-combat-scaffold` at `311c6f0`; worker push was
  blocked by credentials, so root cherry-picked it into `main` at `01f831e`;
  story-done committed at `9589116`. Window can be cleared.
- HAND-UI-003 worker: launch prompt issued while CA-005 story-done is active;
  per user rule, assume launched unless contradicted. Completed on branch
  `work/hand-ui-003-phase-state-machine` at `c6e5504`; cherry-picked into
  `main` at `614e68e`. Worker checks passed; root `cargo fmt -p client --
  --check` and `git diff --check HEAD~1..HEAD` passed; story-done committed at
  `d55a3d5`. Window can be cleared.
- HUD-005 worker: launch prompt issued while CA-005 story-done is active; per
  user rule, assume launched unless contradicted. Completed on branch
  `work/hud-005-phase-transitions` at `5061728`; cherry-picked into `main` at
  `9104400`. Worker checks passed; root re-check hit long client compile
  timeout, not a test failure; story-done committed at `3230dce`. Window can
  be cleared.
- BOARD-005 worker: launch prompt issued while CA-005 story-done is active; per
  user rule, assume launched unless contradicted. Initial readiness returned
  NEEDS WORK only because the story embedded manifest version was stale
  (`2026-04-29` vs current `2026-05-01`); dependencies and ADRs passed.
  Story manifest was refreshed, so this window should retry readiness and then
  implement if READY. Correct ADR file is
  `docs/architecture/adr-007-placement-buffer.md`. Completed locally on branch
  `work/board-005-placement-buffer-phase-integration` at `4946ea2`; worker push
  was blocked by credentials, so root cherry-picked it into `main` at `86ecbcb`.
  Repair committed at `9175598`; story-done committed at `1dbd2cf`.
  Window can be cleared.

## Tracker In-Progress But No Live Window Confirmed

These are marked `in-progress` in `production/sprint-status.yaml`, but the user
confirmed no corresponding agent window is currently running. Treat them as
stale/incomplete until explicitly relaunched or closed:
None currently tracked here.

## Recently Implemented, Needs Formal Story-Done

- BOARD-006: Charge Bonus Movement implemented locally on branch
  `work/board-006-charge-bonus-movement` at `874f28e`; worker push was blocked
  by external GitHub transfer approval, so root cherry-picked and amended the
  integration commit into `main` at `a04022b`. Root `cargo fmt -p server --
  --check`, `cargo test -p server --test charge_movement_test --test
  standard_movement_test`, `cargo check -p server`, and
  `git diff --check HEAD~1..HEAD` passed.
- RSM-005: Disconnect Handling implemented locally on branch
  `work/rsm-005-disconnect-handling` at `8007ad1`; worker push was blocked by
  external GitHub transfer approval, so root cherry-picked/rebased it onto
  `main` at `e4fb6a4`. Root `cargo fmt -p server -- --check`,
  `cargo test -p server rsm_disconnect`, `cargo check -p server`, and
  `git diff --check HEAD~1..HEAD` passed.
- CARD-ANIM-003: Simultaneous Track Animation implemented on branch
  `work/card-anim-003-simultaneous-track-animation` at `4f4d7c5`; worker pushed
  branch but did not run story-done. Worker checks passed:
  `cargo fmt -p client -- --check`,
  `cargo test -p client --test card_animations_tracks_animation_test`,
  existing card animation regressions 26/26, `cargo check -p client`, and
  boundary grep against direct S2C readers/EventReader/EventWriter/Tracks usage.
- GSS-004: F4 SessionReady Predicate and Trigger implemented on branch
  `work/gss-004-f4-session-ready` at `9708147`; root cherry-picked it into
  `main` at `4d8cf60`. Worker checks passed full affected session/RSM/economy
  regression set plus full `cargo test -p server`; grep gates confirmed exactly
  one `On<SessionReady>` observer path.
- PRISM-001: Prism State Scaffold implemented on branch
  `work/prism-001-state-scaffold` at `6ecd421`; root cherry-picked it into
  `main` at `e093804`. Worker checks passed `cargo fmt -p server -- --check`,
  `cargo test -p server --test prism_state_scaffold_test`, `cargo check -p server`,
  and board/objective adjacent regression tests.

## Story-Done Queue

1. BOARD-006
2. RSM-005
3. CARD-ANIM-003
4. GSS-004
5. PRISM-001

Run only one story-done at a time.

## Launch Blocks / Wait Conditions

- BOARD-006: implemented and integrated; pending story-done.
- RSM-005: implemented and integrated; pending story-done.
- CARD-ANIM-003: implemented on worker branch; pending root integration check and
  story-done after the current serialized closures.
- GSS-004: implemented and integrated; pending story-done. Do not launch further
  SessionReady/RSM session stories until closure confirms the single-observer gate.
- PRISM-001: implemented and integrated; pending story-done before launching
  PRISM-002+.
- AUC-004: ECO-005 is formally closed; still verify OQ9 pre-implementation gate
  before launch.
- Prism gates are resolved; PRISM-002+ follow normal sequencing after PRISM-001
  story-done.

## Next Parallel Launch Candidates

Batch launched:
- BOARD-006: integrated, pending story-done.
- RSM-005: integrated, pending story-done.
- GSS-004: integrated, pending story-done.
- PRISM-001: integrated, pending story-done.
- CARD-ANIM-003: worker branch implemented, pending story-done.

BOARD-006 story-done is currently expected to be active from user launch. The
next serialized closure after it returns is RSM-005.

## Resolved Design Gates

- OQ-KS9: resolved in `design/gdd/combat-resolution.md` via `f8ceafd`.
- OQ-HUD-05: resolved in HUD story 004 via `64b0cfd`; HUD story 004 still has
  other blockers and should not be implemented yet.
- KW-SC-1: `On<UnitDied>` observer param compile probe passed with
  `cargo check -p server`; no permanent files were needed.

## Current Dirty-Tree Notes

As of the asset sorting pass, generated art assets were moved into `assets/art/`
and committed. `.codex-tmp/` is ignored as a local scratch workspace. Use
worktree mode for all new code workers.
