## Dependency Layers

```
FOUNDATION            CORE                  NETWORKING
Card Data & Pool ──►  Economy System ──►    Network Protocol ──►  (all Feature systems)
Game Config      ──►  Board/Lane System ──► Game Session System
Server-side RNG  ──►  Objective System
                      Round State Machine

FEATURE (depend on Core + Networking)
Card Acquisition · Auction System · Prism System
Combat Resolution · Keyword System · Class System

PRESENTATION (depend on Feature systems they display)
Board Rendering · Hand UI · Shop/Auction UI · HUD · Card Animations
```

**Bottleneck systems** (most others depend on these):
- `Card Data & Pool` — every system reads card definitions
- `Economy System` — shop, auction, prisms, combat rewards
- `Network Protocol` — auction, placement, resolution sync
- `Round State Machine` — all phase transitions

## Progress Tracker

### M1 — Core Loop
*Goal: Two players connect, play one full round, and the round resolves correctly.*

| # | System | File | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Card Data & Pool | `gdd/card-data-pool.md` | Approved | /design-review 2026-04-29 (Pass 3). 7 blockers resolved: draw_shop_slot split into draw_class_card/draw_neutral_family/draw_family_card (Option C, aligns with server-rng.md seed table); SlotType enum defined; OQ7 resolved (auction is shared/common pool, separate from per-player shop pools — no collision); C-B4 resolved (refresh policy documented, Card Acquisition owns display-slot state and fallback logic); fallback contract clarified (pool returns None cleanly, caller routes); CP7 rewritten (behavioral test); 12 new ACs (CP-IC, CP-SHC/SHN, CP-NW, CP3c/d, CP-C2/C3, CP5c, CP7b); CP9 reclassified BLOCKING; edge cases added (late-game class exhaustion, eligible_types=1); Economy→Pool dependency direction corrected. N-B1 (refresh_base_cost) confirmed resolved in game-config.md. |
| 2 | Game Config | `gdd/game-config.md` | Approved | /design-review 2026-04-29 + cross-review fixes: refresh_base_cost added (N-B1 ✓), interest_threshold_gold added, reserve_mana_cap removed (design decision: no cap), 5 RSM timer fields, epic/legendary moved to const, 13 ACs rewritten. |
| 3 | Server-side RNG | `gdd/server-rng.md` | Approved | /design-review 2026-04-29. 8 blockers resolved: Rule 5 rewritten as 3 per-phase chains (DRAFT_INITIAL/RESOLUTION/SHOP), fake-objective initial assignment added to seed table (2 seeds/player), shop slot seed count corrected (2–3/slot), Rule 6 inter-player ordering added (ascending player_id→lane→position), Formula 1b added for CDF weighted selection, Formula 1 preconditions added, AuditEntry type corrected to Option<String> with encoding table, 4 invalid ACs removed and 7 new ACs added (RNG11–15). |
| 4 | Economy System | `gdd/economy-system.md` | Approved | /design-review 2026-04-29 + cross-review fixes: interest formula updated to use GameConfig.interest_threshold_gold (C-B5a ✓), reserve_mana_cap removed (design decision: no cap, organic pressure is limiter), free pick uncapped per design decision (B-3 ✓), refresh_base_cost knob documented. Warning C-W1 remains: Interactions table needs interest_threshold_gold added. |
| 5 | Board / Lane System | `gdd/board-lane-system.md` | Approved | /design-review 2026-04-28. All 14 blocking items resolved: player fantasy rewritten (forensic prediction, not live read), prism respawn confirmed per-player independent (OQ1 closed), F1/F2/F3 formula type safety + direction tables fixed, pending buffer architecture specified (Resource not entities), S2CPlacementReveal + replay log specified, 12 ACs rewritten + 5 new ACs (BL-27b/30/31/32/33). WALL farming and global spawn range kept by design. |
| 6 | Round State Machine | `gdd/round-state-machine.md` | Approved | /design-review 2026-04-29. 13 blockers resolved: disconnect grace 5s→30s, RESOLUTION safety timeout added (60s→Draw), Rule 5/F2 shop refresh inconsistency fixed, StartAuction added to F2 sequence, S2CGameOver+GameOverReason enum defined, ready signal now retractable, RSM-31 BLOCKING, RSM-32–38 added. 4 open questions remain (lobby_timeout, DRAFT_INITIAL gold forfeiture, multiplayer auction, late-joiner sync). |
| 7 | Network Protocol | `gdd/network-protocol.md` | Approved | /design-review R3 2026-04-29: APPROVED. Fixed inline: timer_duration_secs/new_timer_secs/grace_remaining_secs → _ms throughout (NP + RSM + entities.yaml). 29 ACs (28 BLOCKING). Open: Lightyear 0.26 unicast API, component visibility filtering, reliable channel ordering (OQ1–3). |
| 8 | Game Session System | `gdd/game-session-system.md` | Approved | /design-review R3 2026-04-29: APPROVED. Fixed inline: game-config.md GSS row corrected (disconnect_grace_seconds removed; lobby_heartbeat_timeout_seconds noted pending); transitions table: "RSM fires SessionReady" → "GSS fires SessionReady"; ServerRng init failure → LOBBY_CANCELLED row added. 41 ACs. All modes in scope (1v1, 2v2, 3v3). lobby_heartbeat_timeout_seconds added to game-config.md + entities.yaml (OQ8 resolved). ADR needed for SessionReady Observer vs Events<T> (OQ7). |
| 9 | Objective System | `gdd/objective-system.md` | Approved | /design-review R3 2026-04-29: APPROVED. Fixed inline: game-config.md fake_count upper bound tightened ≤4→≤3 + GC8c AC added; OS-17 conditional language cleaned up (ADR-001 resolved). XL scope — 9 cross-system deps, 5 formulas. Sang Méprise reconnect gap forwarded to NP backlog (active_sang_meprise_identities missing from S2CGameSnapshot). |

### M2 — Playable Game
*Goal: Complete 1v1 game with auction, combat, shop, and win condition — visually playable.*

| # | System | File | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | Card Acquisition | `gdd/card-acquisition.md` | Approved | /design-review 2026-04-29: 6 blockers resolved. Single-fire auction refresh (DRAFT_AUCTION entry only; same slots persist to DRAFT_SHOP). RSM Rule 12 gold carry-over confirmed. ERR_WRONG_PHASE → silent discard (NP wins). CA18 rollback: refund_gold() specified. shop_weight_per_card design note (raise to 0.20–0.25). 22 ACs (CA1–CA22). refresh_cap added to game-config.md. S2CShopSlots/S2CDraftOffering registered in NP GDD. OQs 1–2 resolved. OQs 3–5 open. |
| 11 | Auction System | `gdd/auction-system.md` | In Review | **Signature mechanic** — /design-review 2026-04-29: MAJOR REVISION → revised in-session (14 blockers resolved). Variable bid sizing primary; shop NOT interactable; S2CGoldBroadcast requires `reserved_gold` (NP GDD update needed); Legendary stratified to R6+; u32 saturating_sub required; hand-full warning; locally-expired client state; 6 new ACs (AU15–AU19); M7 split; OQ7 (wealth disparity), OQ8 (no-bid frequency), OQ9 (AuctionExpired reachability). AU1-b blocked on NP OQ3. Re-review after NP GDD `reserved_gold` update. |
| 12 | Combat Resolution | `gdd/combat-resolution.md` | Designed | 6-sub-step global-pass resolution, step-by-step collision, WALL blocking (board GDD deviation → OQ1 ADR needed), RANGE sub-step 6 (RANGE+FS attacks twice), full modifier stack, 4 formulas (net_damage, type_advantage, objective_damage ref, RANGE target), 34 ACs (CR-1–CR-34: 30 BLOCKING). Visual/Audio: art-director reviewed (color conventions, 12-step impl priority, 5 VFX principles). 5 OQs: WALL ADR, type advantage GameConfig, RANGE RNG seed, COUNTERATTACK proximity, ResolutionEvent enum. /design-review pending (fresh session). |
| 13 | Board Rendering | `gdd/board-rendering.md` | Not Started | Visual 5-lane grid, unit sprites at cells, health bars, Ankama art style |
| 14 | Hand UI | `gdd/hand-ui.md` | Not Started | Card fan display, card selection, play confirmation during PLACEMENT |
| 15 | Shop / Auction UI | `gdd/shop-auction-ui.md` | Not Started | 3-card shop slots; auction panel with live price/timer/leader display |
| 16 | HUD | `gdd/hud.md` | Not Started | Gold, mana, reserve display; round number; objective status dots (5 per side) |

### M3 — Full Feature
*Goal: All GDD mechanics working — keywords, prisms, class rules, and animations.*

| # | System | File | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 17 | Keyword System | `gdd/keyword-system.md` | Not Started | All triggers: APPEARANCE, DEATH, FINAL BLOW, INJURED, START/END OF TURN; all movement/combat keywords |
| 18 | Prism System | `gdd/prism-system.md` | Not Started | 5 prisms; Lane 1/5 → obj-damage spell; Lane 2/4 → reserve spell card; Lane 3 → draw; respawn |
| 19 | Class System | `gdd/class-system.md` | Not Started | Xelor reserve spells (Gelure, Rollback, etc.); other class-specific rules; interaction matrix |
| 20 | Card Animations | `gdd/card-animations.md` | Not Started | bevy_tweening for card draw, play, unit movement per round, combat resolution reveal |

## Recommended Design Order

Write GDDs in this order (each one depends on those before it being designed first):

```
1  → Card Data & Pool       (everything reads this)
2  → Game Config            (all numbers in one place)
3  → Server-side RNG        (simple, needed early)
4  → Economy System         (mana + gold model)
5  → Round State Machine    (phase flow — context for all other GDDs)
6  → Network Protocol       (what travels over the wire)
7  → Board / Lane System    (spatial model)
8  → Objective System       (win condition)
9  → Card Acquisition       (shop + draft + hand)
10 → Auction System         (signature mechanic — design this carefully)
11 → Combat Resolution      (damage + movement)
12 → Game Session System    (room + lobby)
13 → Board Rendering        (visual board)
14 → Hand UI
15 → Shop / Auction UI      (UX for signature mechanic)
16 → HUD
17 → Keyword System         (extends combat)
18 → Prism System
19 → Class System
20 → Card Animations
```

## High-Risk Systems

| System | Risk | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Auction System | HIGH | Real-time multiplayer + lightyear sync + signature mechanic feel |
| Network Protocol | HIGH | Blocks 8+ other systems; Lightyear 0.26 is post-training-cutoff |
| Combat Resolution | HIGH | Most complex logic; interacts with 5 other systems |
| Keyword System | HIGH | ~20 keywords, many interactions; untested edge cases |
